# Advent of Code - 2025

This repo holds my solutions for the Advent of Code 2025 puzzles. I did not create a login, so all the solutions are based on the puzzle descriptions without running any additional input.

All files are Marimo Notebooks. If you clone the repository you can easily run them with uv:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LFKoning/AOC-2025.git
cd AOC-2025
uv run marimo edit AoC_1.py
```

This will create a virtual environment, install Marimo in it and open the Notebook in your browser.

If you don't want to clone the repo, you can open individual Notebooks directly from Github too:

```bash
uv venv -p 3.12
uv pip install marimo
uv run marimo edit https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LFKoning/AOC-2025/refs/heads/main/AoC_1.py
```

Enjoy!
